            <h2 class="titleRb">Problem</h2>
        
            <p class="pRb">Reebok, a well-known American sport and lifestyle brand, seeks to modify people's perceptions of men wearing EasyTone shoes while promoting a 25% discount on its products. Married men between the ages of 35 and 50 who prioritize their families over their careers and earn between $70,000 and $90,000 a year make up the target audience. They struggle because of time constraints from work and family obligations, even though they want to stay in shape. Reebok's brand voice is sympathetic and cognizant of the difficulties men encounter in juggling their obligations. The main takeaway is that busy men who find it difficult to fit into traditional exercise regimens can benefit from Reebok EasyTones.</p>

            <h2 class="titleRb1">Solution</h2>

            <p class="pRb1">As an initial approach for this project different ideas were taken but at the end an a strategic and creative solution,  
                , we were encouraged to take on this project. I decided to give a disruptive and catchy approach, setting the perspective that every man can use these sneakers. I focused on the idea that every person in the world can use them. That's why historical figures were taken to bring to reality this concept, as it was the landing of the first man on the moon, the French Revolution, and James Cleveland "Jesse," the athlete who won four gold medals at the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, Germany.</p>
